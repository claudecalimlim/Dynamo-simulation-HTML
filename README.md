# Dynamo-simulation-HTML
🧠 A browser-based simulation inspired by Amazon’s Dynamo — a highly available key-value store. Built for educational purposes to visualize concepts like data partitioning and replication.
> A lightweight, browser-based simulation inspired by **Amazon’s Dynamo: A Highly Available Key-Value Store**.  
> This project was built for educational purposes to demonstrate key Dynamo concepts such as **data partitioning**, **replication**, and **fault tolerance**.

## 🌟 Features

- 🔑 Simulates key-value storage operations  
- 🔁 Demonstrates replication across nodes  
- ⚙️ Illustrates consistency vs. availability trade-offs  
- 📊 Interactive visualization of node behavior (if applicable)

## 🧠 Background

Amazon’s **Dynamo** is a distributed storage system designed for **high availability** and **fault tolerance**.  
This simulation aims to visualize how Dynamo handles read/write requests and data replication even during node failures.
